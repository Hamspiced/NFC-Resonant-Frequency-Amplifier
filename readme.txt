Project Repository for the Resonant Repeater Project

Goal:
Create a low-cost adaptable device that can amplify 13.56Mhz frequencies for low power devices, implants, etc.  
Initial idea is to take already made tuned NFC Chips from Keyfobs, harvest the antenna from them, find out the resonant capacetence, introduce a capacitor and tune as needed.


Proof of concept.

Magnet Wire coil with a capacitor to test.

Using online calculators i determined my .5mm magnet wire wrapped 5 times at 50mm width should be resonant at 13.56mhz.

Tuning was successfull
